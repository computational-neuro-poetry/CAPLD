# CAPLD Database & Diachronic_subdatabase

## Overview
This repository contains the **CAPLD database** and its diachronic sub-database, providing lexical diachronic data and word embedding analysis tools for classical Chinese poetry texts. The project supports linguistic diachronic studies through structured data storage and automated scripts.

---
## Data Sources
The raw corpus is sourced from https://github.com/Werneror/Poetry. Our data processing follows the methodology:
 Poems labeled as belonging to *late one dynasty and early the next* were categorized under the earlier dynasty (e.g., works marked as "late Song and early Yuan" were grouped under the Song dynasty category).
